	<p class="lead">Thoughts from the developer, Medha Karri</p>
	<p class="lead">Dec 19, 2021; 03:43PM EST</p>
	<p class="lead">Wishing you all merry christmas and a very happy new year 2022! </p>
		
	<p>I am sure each one of us have had their own crests and troughs in 2021. I have had my very low times but yes, in 2021, I've graduated with a masters in computer science degree. It was over-whelming, especially during my last semester but for most of the times, I enjoyed learning new things. Thank you for your "May the force be with you & Good luck with your school" e-mails. I'm joyous :) but at the same time bewildered :( as I now have a mountain of education loan to clear :|. 
		<br/>With the year leaving us only a few days before coming to an end, I have a couple of December updates for our app, Pure Battery Analytics below. 
		<li>Upgraded the icons to the latest Windows Fluent System</li>		
		<li>Enhanced Performance and</li>
		<li>Insights into which apps are taking most of your battery/energy</li>
		<li>Finally, the most requested feature, Dark Mode.</li>
				
		<br/>Thank you for making <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH4X4K3">Pure Battery Analytics</a>, one of the best rated battery apps for Windows 10 on the Microsoft store. 
		My dad used to tell me, "Always wish good for others and good things will automatically happen to you. That's what is called 'Karma'." 		
		I hope & wish you have a great holiday time and a wonderful year a head. Thank you again.</p>
