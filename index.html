	<h1 class="display-4">Hello World!</h1>
	<p class="lead">Thoughts from the developer, Medha Karri</p>
	<p class="lead">Dec, 16, 2021</p>
	<p class="lead">Wishing you all merry christmas and a very happy new year 2022! </p>
		
	<p>I am sure each one of us have had their own crests and troughs in 2021. I have had my very low times but yes, in 2021, I've graduated with a masters in computer science degree. It was over-whelming, especially during my last semester but for most of the times, I enjoyed learning new things. Thank you for your "May the force be with you & Good luck with your school" e-mails. I'm joyous :) but at the same time bewildered :( as I now have a mountain of education loan to clear :|. 
		With the year almost coming to an end, I have a couple of December updates for Pure Battery Analytics below. 
		<li>Fluent System Icons</li>		
		<li>Performance Enhancements and</li>
		<li>Finally, the most requested feature, Dark Mode</li>
		<br>
		Thank you for making Pure Battery Analytics, one of the best rated battery apps for Windows 10 on the Microsoft store. 
		My dad used to tell me, "Always wish good for others and good things will automatically happen to you. That's what is called 'Karma'." 
		I hope & wish you have a great holiday time and a wonderful year a head. Thank you.</p>
