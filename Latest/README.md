Add as many as battery percentage values to get notified accordingly. 
 Examples below: 
  * 20 - Notifies only when battery is 20%
  * 30,90 - Notifies when battery is 30% or 90%.
  * 10,50,80,90 - Notifies whenever battery is 10% or 50% or 80% or 90%.

![You can now choose to notify at multiple battery percentages](https://github.com/medhachaitanya/PureBatteryAddOnSetup/blob/master/Screenshots/LatestScreenshot.PNG)
